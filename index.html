<p>This is a short domain I reseved for fun. I typically use it for redirects. But in case you're stopping by to verify that this is a real domain, here are some of my projects:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://loganrath.info">My personal website</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://608.lib.wtf">IST 608: Research Methods</a></li>
</ul>
